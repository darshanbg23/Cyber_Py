# Brute-Force Login Script (Educational Use Only)

**Important:** This project is an educational tool built to test **your local** website (a Flask app). It is intentionally restricted to **localhost** targets and a **POST**-based login endpoint at `/login` to prevent misuse. Do **not** run this against third-party or production websites — doing so may be illegal.

---

## Project summary

A simple Python script that automates username/password attempts against a local POST login endpoint (`/login`). It reads wordlists, posts credentials to the local site, detects successful logins by matching the HTML success text, saves valid credentials to a JSON file, and prints clear, colorized progress messages.

---

## Features (detailed, bullet points)

* **Local-only guard**

  * The script refuses to run unless the `target` contains `127.0.0.1` or `localhost`. This guard prevents accidental or illegal use against remote sites.

* **POST-based login targeting**

  * Sends form-encoded POST requests to the `/login` endpoint of the provided `target` (constructed as `target.rstrip("/") + "/login"`). This matches the local Flask app used for development.

* **Wordlist support**

  * Loads usernames and passwords from the files you supply (one entry per line). Blank lines are ignored.

* **Simple success detection**

  * Detects a successful login by searching the HTML response for the exact success phrase: `Successfully Logged In` (case-insensitive). When the phrase is found, that username:password pair is treated as valid.

* **Results persistence**

  * All discovered valid credentials are saved into `results.json` in pretty-printed JSON format, suitable for inspection or downstream processing.

* **Colorized console output**

  * Uses `colorama` to show attempts, successes and failures with distinct colors:

    * Yellow: attempts
    * Green: successful credential
    * Red: errors and failures
    * Cyan: informational messages

* **Robust error handling**

  * Handles and reports:

    * Connection errors (site unreachable) — prints a clear error and exits.
    * Timeouts — prints a timeout message and exits.
    * Other request exceptions — printed and script exits to avoid confusing behavior.
  * This prevents noisy output when the local site is down.

* **Built-in help / usage**

  * A help screen is available via `-h` or `--help`.
  * The help text is also shown automatically if required arguments are not provided, so users immediately see how to run the script.

* **Safe default behavior**

  * Introduces a small delay between attempts (`time.sleep(0.5)`) to avoid overwhelming the local test server.

* **Compatibility with the local Flask demo**

  * The Flask demo is expected to use a `valid_users.csv` (or `users.csv`) file. That file contains valid username,password lines which the demo server uses to validate incoming login attempts.

## Modules used and their purpose

| Module       | Type     | Purpose                                                                                                                      |
| ------------ | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **requests** | External | Used to send HTTP POST requests to the target login endpoint. Handles sessions, timeouts, and exceptions.                    |
| **sys**      | Built-in | Handles command-line argument control and allows the script to exit on specific conditions.                                  |
| **time**     | Built-in | Introduces a delay between requests to avoid overwhelming the server.                                                        |
| **json**     | Built-in | Saves discovered valid credentials in a readable JSON format (`results.json`).                                               |
| **colorama** | External | Adds color to terminal output for better readability and distinction between success, failure, and info messages.            |
| **argparse** | Built-in | Parses and validates command-line arguments. Provides help and usage instructions.                                           |
| **flask**    | External | Used in the accompanying Flask demo server (`flask_server.py`) to simulate a local web login system using `valid_users.csv`. |

```
.
├─ brute.py                 # Your final brute-force script
├─ flask_server.py          # Optional: local Flask server that reads valid_users.csv and serves /login
├─ valid_users.csv          # CSV of valid users for the Flask demo (format: username,password)

## Example `valid_users.csv` format (used by the local Flask server)

```
admin,admin123
user,password
root,toor
test,test
```

The Flask demo should read this file and use it to validate POSTed credentials on `/login`.

---

## Usage

### 1. Install dependencies

From your project directory:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. (Optional) Run the local Flask server for testing

```bash
python3 flask_server.py
# Server should start on: http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

Ensure `valid_users.csv` is present in the same directory so the server can validate credentials.

### 3. Run the brute-force script

```bash
python3 brute.py http://127.0.0.1:5000 usr.txt pass.txt
```

### 4. Help / usage

```bash
python3 brute.py -h
# or
python3 brute.py --help
```

If you omit required arguments the script will print the help text automatically.

---

## Output example

If the credentials `test:test` are valid, console output will show:

```
[>] Attempting test:test
    [+] Valid password 'test' found for user 'test'!
Results saved to results.json
```

`results.json` will contain:

```json
[
  {
    "username": "test",
    "password": "test"
  }
]
```

---

## Error handling behavior

* If the local site is **not running** or unreachable, the script prints:

  ```
  [!] Error: Unable to connect to http://127.0.0.1:5000. The website may be down or unreachable.
  ```

  and exits with a non-zero status.

* If a request **times out**, the script prints a timeout message and exits.

* Any other request exceptions are printed and the script exits to avoid ambiguous results.

## Security & Legal notice (read carefully)

This tool is strictly for **educational and authorized testing only**. Use it **only** against systems you own or where you have explicit written permission (for example, your local Flask server or a lab environment). Unauthorized use of brute-force techniques against third-party systems is likely illegal and unethical. The script explicitly prevents non-localhost targets to reduce the risk of misuse.

---

## requirements.txt

Minimal (recommended) `requirements.txt`:

```
flask
requests
colorama
```

> Note: `argparse`, `json`, `sys`, and `time` are part of the Python standard library and do not require installation.
